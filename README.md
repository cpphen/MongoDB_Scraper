# MongoDB_Scraper

- Use MongoDB/Mongoose, MVC pattern, and web scraping to create an app that will feature commenting on articles. 
  Users will be able to click on a "scrape" button which will then store the articles/data from the targeted website
  into the MongoDB. These articles can be saved by the client as well. If an article is saved, it will be removed from
  the initial page where the scraped articles are displayed and shown on a "saved articles" page where users will be 
  able to comment on the articles.

- The view engine of choice is handlebars/mustache

- Each Comment will be relevant to the appropriate articles by making the right associations between the Article model
  and the Comment model
